stvstats

A Perl 5 script that outputs special statistics about Single Transferrable
Vote elections in Sycamore wiki format tables (easily human readable). 
Takes an openSTV ballot file as input.

Does not actually run an STV election, but produces the following data
about the election:
 * Top N seats -- what if the election was vote for N candidates?
 * Last place votes -- who got the most among voters who ranked everyone
 * Ballot length -- how many ranks by how many voters

Usage:

perl stvstats.pl [-i] [-c] [-t#] filename.blt

Output Options
  -i   Print candidate IDs in the output table
  -c   Print colors given in the file into the candidate table
  -t#  Top # seats instead of the amount given in the ballot file
